# Software Development
This respository contains code files intended to illustrate my understanding of object orientated programming and software development. Both files make use of core programming concepts such as variables, conditional and looping statements, functions and classes as well as more advanced concepts such as inheritance, wrapper classes and threading. This corresponds to the learning outcomes of the modules
